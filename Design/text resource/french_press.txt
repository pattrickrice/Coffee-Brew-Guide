French Press

The french press is perhaps the easiest brew-method to achieve a good tasting cup of coffee. The method a full-emersion technique and filters through a metal screen. The method has the biggest body/mouth feel due to the high amount of sediment that passes through the screen; this also results in muted acidity and nuanced flavors.

Directions
1. Pour a small amount of hot water into the vessel to  preheat.
2. Grind the coffee on a course/french press setting.
3. Pour out pre-heat water and dump in grounds.
4. Start timer and pour in INT grams of water.
5. With a spoon, stir wet grounds to fully expose to water.
6. Let sit for 30 seconds
7. Last pour to finish at INT UNITS.
8. At 4:00 minutes, gently press plunger to completion.
9. Pour out all of coffee into cup or carraff to serve, leaving none left in the french press. Coffee left in the french press will continue to brew and could over extract.
10. Enjoy
