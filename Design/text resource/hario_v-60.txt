Hario V-60

The hario V-60 is capable of so much, but it is easy to mess up. When done right, the body is smooth and those bright acidic notes really shine through the cup. The V-60 is a pour-over drip with ridges on the walls of the vessel which allow for greater flow. Detail to your method of pouring is required and a gooseneck kettle is reccomended.

Step 1. Place vessel either on top of coffee cup or on stand with cup/carafe below.
Step 2. Crease the paper filter along the ridged edge, place the filter in the brewer and completely wet with hot water.
Step 3. Grind the coffee on a V-60/paper filter setting, dump grounds in brewer, dump out hot water from cup/carafe.
Step 4. Start timer and make initial pour of INT UNITS, take a spoon and stir the grounds to ensure that all grinds are wet. Let bloom.
Step 5. At 45 seconds, slowly pour bringing the total amount of water to INT UNITS. When pouring, make small concentric circles in the center, ensuring to not touch the sides of the brewer. Pour should be 15 seconds finishing at 1:00.
Step 6. At 1:30 begin third pour, bringing the total amount of water to INT UNITS, finishing at 1:45.
Step 7. At 2:00 begin the last pour, bringing the toal amount of water to INT UNITS, finishing at 2:15.
Step 8. Coffee should finish dripping around 2:30-3:15, remove brewer and stir contents of cup to fully integrate the coffee.
